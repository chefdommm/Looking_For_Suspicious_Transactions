## Assignment Requirements 
Fraud is everywhere these days. There are emerging technologies that use artificial intelligence to detect fraud, many instances of fraud detection still require strong data analytics to find abnormal charges.
This homework assignment, I had create querys in SQL to analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
## Tasks:


### Data Modeling:
1) I had to create a database model to store the credit card transactions data and create a new PostgreSQL database using my model.


2) I had to create a database schema on PostgreSQL and populate a database from the CSV files provided.


3)I had to Analyze the data to identify possible fraudulent transactions trends data, and develop a report of my observations

4) I had to create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) by inspecting the provided CSV files.



### Data Engineering
1) Using my database model as a blueprint, I had to create a database schema for each of my tables and relationships. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any other constraints you defined.
2) After creating the database schema, I had to import the data from the corresponding CSV files.

### Data Analysis

#### Part 1:
The CFO of my firm requested a report to help analyze potential fraudulent transactions. Using the data base, I had to  generate queries. 


1) I had to  isolate (or group) the transactions of each cardholder?


2) Count the transactions that are less than $2.00 per cardholder.


3) I had to find evidence to suggest that a credit card has been hacked.

4) I had to find the top 100 highest transactions made between 7:00 am and 9:00 am?


5) I had to visualize any anomalous transactions that could be fraudulent


6) I had to determine if there was a higher number of fraudulent transactions made during this time frame versus the rest of the day







7) I had to create a view for each of my queries.



## Part 2:
1) I was also requested to detailed trends data on specific card holders.


2) I had to verify if there were  any fraudulent transactions in their history. 


3) I had to use a  hvPlot tocreate a line plot representing the time series of transactions over the course of the year for each cardholder separately.


4) I had to compare their patterns and  create a single line plot that contains both card holders' trend data.




5) I had to use Plotly Express to create a box plot, representing the expenditure data from January 2018 to June 2018 for cardholder ID 25.
